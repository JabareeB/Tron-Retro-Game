## Honesty Statement
This project was completed by Jabaree Bangura, I independently and did not download or copy someone else's project code as my own.

## Player Control
In this 3D game, players control a light cycle navigating through a grid-based arena. Movement is controlled using arrow keys. As the light cycle moves, it leaves behind a trail wall, which is central to the gameplay.

## Basic Gameplay
**Goals/Objectives:**
- Navigate the light cycle through the arena while avoiding opponents' light trail walls.
- Use your light trail to trap and outsmart opponents.

The game ends when the player's light cycle collides with an opponent's light cycle or the arena barrier. This game emphasizes strategic movement and planning, differentiating it from other games by focusing on outsmarting opponents rather than direct combat.

## Game Mechanics
- **Power-ups:** Players can collect power-ups that provide temporary abilities such as speed boosts and invincibility.
- **Lives:** Players start with 3 lives. A life is lost if the player's light cycle is destroyed, which can happen through collisions with cycle trails or barriers.
- **Challenge:** As the game progresses, opponents get faster, making the game more challenging and reducing reaction time.

## User Interface
**3D Objects/Assets Included:**
- Light Cycle
- Opponents Light Cycle
- Grid Arena/Plane
- Power-Up Prefabs: Invincibility and Speed
- Score
- Lives
- Tron Title Text

**Scoring:** The score increases each time an opponent is eliminated. The score and lives are displayed at the top of the screen using a UI canvas.

## Sound Effects
- The light cycle produces motorcycle-like noises while accelerating.
- Particle effects include a neon glow from the light cycles. An explosion effect occurs when a player is destroyed.

## Backlog
If I had more time, I would add:
- Multiplayer functionality to play against friends.
- More diverse power-ups to increase gameplay variability.
- A level system with different arenas to navigate.
